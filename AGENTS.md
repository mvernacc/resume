My resume, as an HTML document.

Desires:

- Separation of concerns: `resume.html` should focus on elements and content, keep layout and style in `style.css`.
- Page sze: Resume should fit on an 8.5x11 inch page. The HTML will be converted to a PDF for distribution.
- Style: minimalist styling that keeps the reader's attention on the content.
- Prose: crisp and focused on outcomes. Sentence fragments are ok.
- Content: When asked for proofreading or advice on content, first read the two blog posts from Case Handmer in `references/`.
  - Give advice which is a balance between Handmer's perspective and your general knowledge of what makes a good resume. Quote specific items of advice from Handmer where relevant.
  - No need to read these blog posts for tasks that focus on HTML/CSS coding.
