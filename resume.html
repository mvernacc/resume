        <p>
          Automated maintenance will be critical to the economic viability of fusion energy.
          In a tokamak, the vacuum vessel surrounding the plasma is damaged by energetic particles and must be
          replaced periodically.
          Techniques in these patents are simpler, less risky, and faster than the prior art, reducing plant
          downtime.
          I developed the concept-of-operations for separating the tokamak halves and rotating out the vacuum vessel,
          and drew many of the patent figures.
